## Biography

Hi! I am a third-year PhD student at the sustainable energy and environment thrust of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) under the supervision of [Prof. Tong-Yi Zhang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/ZHANG-Tongyi/mezhangt), [Prof. Jiaqiang Huang](https://seejhuang.people.ust.hk/), and [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng in computer science and technology from Wuhan University in 2022. 

My current research interest lies in AI for batteries, especially battery degradation prediction (battery life prediction, batter degradation trajectory forecasting and state of health estimation) and intelligent battery optimization. More details can be found in my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&view_op=list_works&gmla=AC6lMd8PIH28jI9lFlL_C9WwIrKkPBVFLJ4Q4yxwypYTF9x3S1TySXmdp1jXnovKUUB0Hef-DqMoRood9idOPGrsI-ZUPl0&user=XAGG2pIAAAAJ).
