## Biography

Hi! I am a third-year PhD student at the sustainable energy and environment thrust of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) under the supervision of [Prof. Tong-Yi Zhang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/ZHANG-Tongyi/mezhangt), [Prof. Jiaqiang Huang](https://seejhuang.people.ust.hk/), and [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng in computer science and technology from Wuhan University in 2022. 

My current research interest lies in AI for batteries, especially domain-knowledge-guided AI and interpretable AI for batteries. More details can be found in my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&view_op=list_works&gmla=AC6lMd8PIH28jI9lFlL_C9WwIrKkPBVFLJ4Q4yxwypYTF9x3S1TySXmdp1jXnovKUUB0Hef-DqMoRood9idOPGrsI-ZUPl0&user=XAGG2pIAAAAJ).
